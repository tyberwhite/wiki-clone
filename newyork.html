        <b>New York</b>, often called New York City (NYC),[a] is the most
        populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190
        distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also
        the most densely populated major city in the United States. The city is
        within the southern tip of New York State, and constitutes the
        geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis
        and the New York metropolitan area â€“ the largest metropolitan area in
        the world by urban landmass.[8] With over 20.1 million people in its
        metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined
        statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most
        populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400
        km) of the city.[9] New York City is a global cultural, financial, and
        media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care and
        life sciences,[10] entertainment, research, technology,[11] education,
        politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. New York is the
        most photographed city in the world.[12] Home to the headquarters of the
        United Nations, New York is an important center for international
        diplomacy,[13][14] an established safe haven for global investors,[15]
        and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.

        On the shore of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>,
        Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the
        Great Lakes and the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_watershed"
          >Mississippi River watershed</a
        >. It grew rapidly in the mid-19th century;[7] by 1860, Chicago was the
        youngest U.S. city to exceed a population of 100,000.[8] The Great
        Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed several square miles and left more than
        100,000 homeless,[9] but Chicago's population continued to grow to
        503,000 by 1880 and then doubled to more than a million within the
        decade.[8] The construction boom accelerated population growth
        throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after
        the fire, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world.[10] Chicago
        made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards,
        including new construction styles (such as, Chicago School architecture,
        the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed
        skyscraper).
