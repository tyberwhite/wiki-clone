          major city in the United States. The city is within the southern tip
          of New York State, and constitutes the geographical and demographic
          center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan
          area – the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban
          landmass.[8] With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan
          statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as
          of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities, and
          over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city.[9] New
          York City is a global cultural, financial, and media center with a
          significant influence on commerce, health care and life sciences,[10]
          entertainment, research, technology,[11] education, politics, tourism,
          dining, art, fashion, and sports. New York is the most photographed
          city in the world.[12] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,
          New York is an important center for international diplomacy,[13][14]
          an established safe haven for global investors,[15] and is sometimes
          described as the capital of the world.

          Situated on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor"
            >one of the world's largest natural harbors</a
          >, with water covering 36.4% of its surface area, New York City
          comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a
          respective
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_the_state_of_New_York"
            >county of the state of New York</a
          >. The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County),
          Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and Staten
          Island (Richmond County)—were created when local governments were
          consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898.[16] The city and
          its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal
          immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken
          in New York,[17] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the
          world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born
          outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any
          city in the world as of 2016.[18][19] As of 2022, the New York
          metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product
          of over $2.1 trillion, ranking it first worldwide. If the New York
          metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the
          eighth-largest economy in the world. As of 2022, New York is home to
          the highest number of billionaires and millionaires of any city and,
          in 2017, was the wealthiest city in the world.

          New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the
          southern tip of Manhattan Island by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic">Dutch</a>
          colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New
          Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city
          in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed
          New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his
          brother, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England"
            >Duke of York</a
          >.[20][21] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was
          renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been
          continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the
          capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[22] and has been
          the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted
          millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late
          19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its
          ideals of liberty and peace.[23] In the 21st century, New York has
          emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[24] and
          environmental sustainability,[25][26] and as a symbol of freedom and
          cultural diversity.[27] The New York Times has won the most Pulitzer
          Prizes for journalism and remains the U.S. media's "newspaper of
          record".[28] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the
          world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide,
          citing its cultural diversity.
