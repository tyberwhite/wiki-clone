          New York, often called New York City (NYC),[a] is the most populous
          city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190
          distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is
          also the most densely populated major city in the United States. The
          city is within the southern tip of New York State, and constitutes the
          geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis
          and the New York metropolitan area – the largest metropolitan area in
          the world by urban landmass.[8] With over 20.1 million people in its
          metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined
          statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most
          populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi
          (400 km) of the city.[9] New York City is a global cultural,
          financial, and media center with a significant influence on commerce,
          health care and life sciences,[10] entertainment, research,
          technology,[11] education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion,
          and sports. New York is the most photographed city in the world.[12]
          Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an
          important center for international diplomacy,[13][14] an established
          safe haven for global investors,[15] and is sometimes described as the
          capital of the world.
